This is the course content for Introduction to Data Processing with
Python, which has been developed and maintained by
[OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org).

# Welcome

Welcome to Introduction to Data Processing with Python. In this workshop we will take you through the fundamentals of working with text and other types of data with Python. We'll learn how to read data from files into data structures in our program, to extract the information we want. We'll display that data in graphs and charts, and get a glimpse of the world of Open Data that's available online. You'll never want to wrangle a spreadsheet again!

We only expect you to know a little Python, not a lot. If you've done our
[Introduction to Programming](http://opentechschool.github.com/python-beginners/en/index.html)
workshop then that will be perfect.
